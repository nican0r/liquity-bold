# Contract: ERC20

## Metadata

- **Name**: ERC20
- **Type**: Contract
- **Path**: lib/openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol
- **Documentation**:  @dev Implementation of the {IERC20} interface.
   This implementation is agnostic to the way tokens are created. This means
   that a supply mechanism has to be added in a derived contract using {_mint}.
   For a generic mechanism see {ERC20PresetMinterPauser}.
   TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide
   https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226[How
   to implement supply mechanisms].
   The default value of {decimals} is 18. To change this, you should override
   this function so it returns a different value.
   We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert
   instead returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless
   conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20
   applications.
   Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
   This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
   by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
   these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
   Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}
   functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting
   allowances. See {IERC20-approve}.

## Events

### Transfer (inherited from IERC20)

```solidity
///  @dev Emitted when `value` tokens are moved from one account (`from`) to
///  another (`to`).
///  Note that `value` may be zero.
event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value);
```

### Approval (inherited from IERC20)

```solidity
///  @dev Emitted when the allowance of a `spender` for an `owner` is set by
///  a call to {approve}. `value` is the new allowance.
event Approval(address indexed owner, address indexed spender, uint256 value);
```
