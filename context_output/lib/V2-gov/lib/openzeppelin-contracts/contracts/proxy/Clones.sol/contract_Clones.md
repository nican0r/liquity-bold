# Contract: Clones

## Metadata

- **Name**: Clones
- **Type**: Contract
- **Path**: lib/V2-gov/lib/openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/proxy/Clones.sol
- **Documentation**:  @dev https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1167[EIP 1167] is a standard for
   deploying minimal proxy contracts, also known as "clones".
   > To simply and cheaply clone contract functionality in an immutable way, this standard specifies
   > a minimal bytecode implementation that delegates all calls to a known, fixed address.
   The library includes functions to deploy a proxy using either `create` (traditional deployment) or `create2`
   (salted deterministic deployment). It also includes functions to predict the addresses of clones deployed using the
   deterministic method.
