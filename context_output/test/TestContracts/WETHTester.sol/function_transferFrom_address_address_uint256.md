## Documentation

### Function Documentation

 @dev See {IERC20-transferFrom}.
 Emits an {Approval} event indicating the updated allowance. This is not
 required by the EIP. See the note at the beginning of {ERC20}.
 NOTE: Does not update the allowance if the current allowance
 is the maximum `uint256`.
 Requirements:
 - `from` and `to` cannot be the zero address.
 - `from` must have a balance of at least `amount`.
 - the caller must have allowance for ``from``'s tokens of at least
 `amount`.

### Interface Documentation

 @dev Moves `amount` tokens from `from` to `to` using the
 allowance mechanism. `amount` is then deducted from the caller's
 allowance.
 Returns a boolean value indicating whether the operation succeeded.
 Emits a {Transfer} event.
