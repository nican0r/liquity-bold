## Public/External Functions

### owner()

- **Signature**: `owner()`
- **Visibility**: external
- **Source Range**: 1461:49:220

**Signature:**
```solidity
/// @notice Returns the current owner of the factory
///  @dev Can be changed by the current owner via setOwner
///  @return The address of the factory owner
function owner() external view returns (address);;
```

### feeAmountTickSpacing(uint24)

- **Signature**: `feeAmountTickSpacing(uint24)`

**Signature:**
```solidity
/// @notice Returns the tick spacing for a given fee amount, if enabled, or 0 if not enabled
///  @dev A fee amount can never be removed, so this value should be hard coded or cached in the calling context
///  @param fee The enabled fee, denominated in hundredths of a bip. Returns 0 in case of unenabled fee
///  @return The tick spacing
function feeAmountTickSpacing(uint24 fee) external view returns (int24);;
```

### getPool(address,address,uint24)

- **Signature**: `getPool(address,address,uint24)`
- **Visibility**: external
- **Source Range**: 2423:98:220

**Signature:**
```solidity
/// @notice Returns the pool address for a given pair of tokens and a fee, or address 0 if it does not exist
///  @dev tokenA and tokenB may be passed in either token0/token1 or token1/token0 order
///  @param tokenA The contract address of either token0 or token1
///  @param tokenB The contract address of the other token
///  @param fee The fee collected upon every swap in the pool, denominated in hundredths of a bip
///  @return pool The pool address
function getPool(address tokenA, address tokenB, uint24 fee) external view returns (address pool);;

### createPool(address,address,uint24)

- **Signature**: `createPool(address,address,uint24)`

**Signature:**
```solidity
/// @notice Creates a pool for the given two tokens and fee
///  @param tokenA One of the two tokens in the desired pool
///  @param tokenB The other of the two tokens in the desired pool
///  @param fee The desired fee for the pool
///  @dev tokenA and tokenB may be passed in either order: token0/token1 or token1/token0. tickSpacing is retrieved
///  from the fee. The call will revert if the pool already exists, the fee is invalid, or the token arguments
///  are invalid.
///  @return pool The address of the newly created pool
function createPool(address tokenA, address tokenB, uint24 fee) external returns (address pool);;
