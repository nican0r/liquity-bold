# Contract: SafeERC20

## Metadata

- **Name**: SafeERC20
- **Type**: Contract
- **Path**: lib/V2-gov/lib/openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol
- **Documentation**:  @title SafeERC20
   @dev Wrappers around ERC20 operations that throw on failure (when the token
   contract returns false). Tokens that return no value (and instead revert or
   throw on failure) are also supported, non-reverting calls are assumed to be
   successful.
   To use this library you can add a `using SafeERC20 for IERC20;` statement to your contract,
   which allows you to call the safe operations as `token.safeTransfer(...)`, etc.
